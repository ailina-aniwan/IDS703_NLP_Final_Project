this piece is almost what i want i tried on the white version in an xs and it felt a little too large for me even though its meant to be a looser fit the buttercup yellow behind the lace is very pretty i especially love that part of this tank it provides a nice contrast and allows the detail to stand out the navy is also nice it was on display next to the white and looks better in person than online what i didnt like was the texture of the spandex on the back portion it looks like,Recommend,Recommend

these are the perfect light weight relaxing summer pants the fabric is soft and light and has some stretch so i think they can be worn more fitted way too i dont want to show off my bottom half of my body shape so these are perfect ones to be a bit loose to covers the silhouette but still looks feminine not too loose im 53 115 lb and usually wear 2526 jeans 25 petite gave me the perfect relaxed look without losing the feminine look i think 24 could fit as well but would sn,Recommend,Recommend
i ordered this shirt and was happy to see that it looks just like it does online i love the rusty orange and pale blue contrast with the navy the navy blue underlayer is so flattering and the sheer sleeves are feminine and lovely the shape and pattern are forgiving this brand is really hitting it out of the park these days this blouse runs a bit smaller than some meadow rue if youre between sizes especially armwise id order up otherwise just get your regular size the body is flo,Recommend,Recommend

i was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and its stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option unlike other reviewers i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines i received the dress yesterday am wearing it today and have already received compliments from even the most sourfaced coworkers who cant give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway the sunny ye,Recommend,Recommend
i loved this jacket its exactly what i was looking for i set out to find a lightweight sweater or jacket that would keep me warm and also versatile enough to wear with different outfits this definitely fit the bill in addition its really soft and not at all itchy which was a concern i had since it was wool and i ordered it online i have received a bunch of compliments i definitely recommend it,Recommend,Recommend
several months ago i bought the byron lars pieced brocade dress size 10 its a little large through the torso area but with the belt it fits good enough since i have loved this dress so much i wanted another byron lars dress so i bought the carissima sheath and the sunrose dress both in a 10 they both were way too big so i ordered a size 8 and they both just barely fit oh was i disappointedso one more try i ordered this dress the allusione sheath size 10 and yepeee it fits perfect,Recommend,Recommend
the stitched pattern on this shirt is so pretty it fits loosely and looks good with a slimmer bottom it is a little bit itchy but i didnt feel i needed to wear something underneath,Recommend,Recommend
this is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable i am always an xl in retailer tops but i needed to go down to a large on this one this blouse is cut generously everywhere but going down one size was perfect for me the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area so it has a very nice drape in the back the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow i wore a nude bra underneath and i cant see m,Recommend,Recommend
love this but it is not a true white its slightly ivory winter white please be accurate with color descriptions its extremely frustrating when online retailers dont describe colors accurately it can be hard to see subtle color differences in photos especially with the color white due to lighting of the shot we rely on descriptions when ordering online its not difficult to do really its not that said i didnt have any armhole trouble as others did they were sized just right,Recommend,Recommend
i love the style and quality of this skirt the material is a bit heavier than anticipated so it works well in cooler months and the thickness makes it easy to wear a shirt underneath it fits true to size my usual 6 is formfitting without being overly snug or pulled i am on the taller side and the skirt is fairly long it comes to the bottom of my knee,Recommend,Recommend

this skirt is amazing it has the right amount of sparkle and the right amount of shape i bought this in a size six which i can really switch between 6 and 8 depending but the six fits perfectly i also bought the regular length even though i could probably be considered petite but it ended up being perfect but the skirt is so lovely in person and has just enough wow that you can wear this thing with a simple tee and still look amazing i wore this to a party with a black high neck tank and re,Recommend,Recommend
i did like the dress but dont love it i think it would have been better for me if it were snugger the xxs petite was still loose and i found that there are so many dresses with the similar fit i decided to pass i also do like both colors the brown is a better choice for me on my skin tone warmer but both are nice i am 115 lbs 30dd 265 in waist,Recommend,Recommend

i love these pants super comfy fit well and a great color i knew immediately when i put them on that i would love them and the button fly to die for wore them and they did stretch out a bit by the end of the day but they didnt look awful and super baggy i bought the other color in a size smaller so they might be better a great pant for summer,Recommend,Recommend
this skirt is very comfortable and fits tts or even runs a bit large i was able to dress it up with a great white shirt and statement necklace great find,Recommend,Recommend
i ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewers comment that they were unflattering on the back side they really do hug your bum but that is not what bothers me what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top they are not wearable in public or around other people i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer but also some of the most poorly designed unfortunately these fall in the latter category,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i love this jess i got it in the blue gray color and i think its going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft im thinking that im going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well,Recommend,Recommend
no only is this a beautiful update to a basic white top it is incredibly soft i couldnt pass it up and wish it came in more colors,Recommend,Recommend
this is a great dress from moving to summer into fall its great right now with the warm temps but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit its very comfortable also there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through maybe you can adjust it at the straps some at any rate its a nice dress and im keeping it,Recommend,Recommend

i typically wear a 26 or 27 in jeans had to size up to a 28 in these the legs felt fine in the size 27 but the waistband was a bit tight so i went with the 28s i am 52 115lbs ill also be hemming or possibly just cutting these off they are about 4 inches longer on me compared to the model pictured,Recommend,Recommend
interesting slightly transparent fabric neckline is not so open as pictured body is boxier than pictured would recommend as a maybe,Recommend,Recommend
i got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater it is extremely soft and warm but not bulky at all it lays really neatly which is why i think of it more like a coat this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring keep in mind though that this does not button theyre just for show,Recommend,Recommend
like the style of a blazer but the fabric of denim looking forward to pairing with dresses and black pants,Recommend,Recommend
i love this cardigan its fit however really depends a lot on an individuals height and build i am about 150 lbs i have slim arms and am larger in the chest my typical size in retailer clothing is m having said that i found that in this top a s fit best it made a difference with how the pockets and lapels lay the pants you wear may affect the look when you snap it closed wearing leggings or slim pants ex pilcro cords gave a much more flattering look to my backside jeansnot so muc,Recommend,Recommend

i bought this in june on a sale and am so glad that i did its so pretty and classy the neck has stretch so its not tight at all its styled like a swing top but it really isnt there isnt much of a fabric abundance to this although it is loose and cool i bought an xl which is my usual size and the fit is fine there are 2 layers of fabric i do not think a cami is needed at all i bought this in black and the floral embroidery just pops im just not a white fan due to cleani,Recommend,Recommend
so this skirt is everything the only downside is that its not in a petite sizing so im going to have to get this altered im 53 the sizing is appropriate usually wear an 8 or 10 in pants and got a size medium for the skirt the material is thick enough for spring or summer weather the color is just right not too light the pockets are adorable and i feel like im channeling some 70s realness sits higher on your waist and is super comfortable i know im going to get a lot of use o,Recommend,Recommend
this dress looks great online with boots as shown when it arrived and i tried it on it fit great on my arms wasnt too tight on my neck but once it went down over my chest 36c the dress never came back in to show my feminine waistshape it just looked like a big trash bag on me very disappointing similar to a mumu,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i ordered this top in small petite but wished i had exchanged it for an xsp because its wide in the arm holes but i love it nonetheless and wear it with a cami underneath i love that while its sleeveless the straps are wide this type of wide top is not for well endowed women up top i dont have that problem so it looks really cute i also love the length a lot of tops tend to be really long and for a petite person shorter tops look best,Recommend,Recommend
i was excited to get this shirt in the mail i liked the pattern a lot but was so disappointed when i tried it on i am 54 130 lbs and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt despite the excess fabric the shirt pulled open in the chest area making it a complete fail im sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric especially since shes small on top ther,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

i am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering i was excited for this to arrive this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall the fabric is decent and the weigh,Recommend,Recommend
i waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed loved the skirt part of it but the top which i guess i didnt see in photo was pleated as well made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides would have been a wonderful summer dress flowing and cool,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
this just arrived today the material is very soft and i love the olive color it has a zipper in the back but i was able to easily slip this over my head making me think it runs a bit large because it is loose the fact that the drop waist hits right at the hip doesnt bother me though i thought it would fall a little lower i am only 52 and i consider this to be a short dress with thick leggings i think it will be great winter dress the bodice is fully lined the skirt is not and the ne,Recommend,Recommend

i loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beigecream it represents it better it made me look very wide loved it online but it wasnt for me returned it,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i wanted to get a couple tops for date nights that went well with skinny jeans and this hit the mark as mentioned before this top is translucent and thus would recommend using a cami as well however the embroidery is beautiful i have not had it cleaned yet and thus cannot comment on the durability cant wait to wear it out,Recommend,Recommend

great top to dress further up or down it does however run large and the straps seem too long if you are a petite you will not be able to wear a regular without alterations,Recommend,Recommend

very soft comfy lightweight sweater perfect for layering as the weather gets cooler looks great with jeans or jean shorts,Recommend,Recommend
very flattering on fitted on top with a loose swingy bottom like most retailer tops it does run a little big i would size down if between sizes the material does seem a little fragile so im not sure how it will hold up i like the lookfit enough that i may get a 2nd color,Recommend,Recommend
this romper is adorable i love the long sleeves,Recommend,Recommend
saw this top online and hoped for the best my hopes were rewarded lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments,Recommend,Recommend
this top is really pretty and nice quality runs big i went down a size and its perfect coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo,Recommend,Recommend
i purchased this top in the wine color and found it to be cute and comfortable the sleeves are not tight which is nice but it is very short and moving your arms away from our sides make this shirt look a little bit like a tent the color is pretty and the button detail is nice overall good purchase but im glad i got it on sale,Recommend,Recommend

i agree with everything the other reviewer stated this top is very billowy and runs large it would be nice if i didnt have a chest the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber the pink is slightly more pink in person but its not that far off had to return,Recommend,Recommend
im 5 0 and 120 pounds this top is beautiful its high neck is so flattering a nice switch it up for us gals that are older and like neck coverage sometimes i purchased a small and it is a little longer but since it has elastic at the waist its no problem i will tuck it in my jeans and skirts the arm holes are perfect the as far as it being a lot of blouse i didnt find that at all but i am busty 34c or d depending on brand of bra the color is ivory omits completely sheer no lin,Recommend,Recommend
perfect sweater to throw on with anything it is fairly thin i wore a cami underneath the sleeves and hem are rolled you have to be careful and it can snag easily happy with my purchase,Recommend,Recommend
i ordered this blazer so i could look more puttogether for work but still feel comfortable it checks both of those boxes its almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure and has a great cutstyle my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes but the white part is actually a light heathered gray i think i would have preferred white but i still like it enough to keep got my normal size small which fit great,Recommend,Recommend
i ordered this because the reviews were outstanding i am returning it although the embroidery looks fine on screen in person it looks cheap and tacky moreover the high ruffled neck goes a step too far into overthetop victorian cutesy overpriced to boot obviously mine is a minority opinion,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

these jeans are very unique thanks to the embroiding would have perferred colorful embroiding though they are boyfriend cut but not slouchy just a bit loose even around athletic legs they run true to size but have a lot of give after wearing them for a a little bit i catch myself pulling them up a bit if you want a snug fit and are between sized i would go down a size,Recommend,Recommend

this dress might be the most comfortable article of clothing i own especially for the hot summers it is attractively loose and so light that you barely feel like you are wearing it love it,Recommend,Recommend
i tried these on at the store and the fit was good the length was even ok for me as a petite person the fabric was substantial and mostly cotton which i like but i felt like the floral pattern drew too much attention to my thighs so it wasnt ultimately something i felt i would wear still a nice comfort piece if you are ok with a floral pattern on your lower half,Recommend,Recommend
i like how this jacket is very versatile you can wear it to work or play it does have interesting detail on it i kept it based on the price and those details i have the olive color the arms are a little tight,Recommend,Recommend
i tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag i think its unique and interesting i just dont think its worth the the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost i would consider it on sale retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price all things considered i dont think its a smart purchase,Recommend,Recommend
its a pretty lowkey no fuss skirt i prefer the ivory color because the details are more visible there are different designs in the same hue the zipper is very thick and sturdy a bonus size 2 regular fit me well the hem falls right above my knees im 52 26 waist 36 hips perfect for work and play a touch of linen keeps the fabric cool for summer but it doesnt wrinkle for the price and the name like thera i expect more flair to match its mediterranean name for those who do,Recommend,Recommend
beautiful pattern and shape however i had to send it back it is extremely see through and ran very small i even sized up and it still pulled in the bust area maybe someone with a smaller bust might fit them better,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i wasnt sure about these when i first took them out but they are so cute the fabric is super soft and skims the bodyis not clingy i got the black the red the red is more of a magenta but im okay with that i think these will be great in the fall and early winter too under cardigans light jackets another bonus they do not show a ton of cleavage like a lot of tops out there the arm holes are also very close to perfect i hate how big the armholes are on tops that basically require,Recommend,Recommend

never spent this much on a dress so it needs to be amazing for me to keep it ive never seen flannel patterns and colors like this the details in the back are unique but in the end i decided to return because its too long and although it fit fine in a size large it didnt look that great on me the dress has an exaggerated drop waist that was too low for my short waisted frame the fabric smells odd i tried belting it but the pockets and back buttons created bulk,Recommend,Recommend

i bought this in the neutral motif and my expectations before trying it on werent high but i was sold once i was in the dress sometimes dresses that have the elastic band in the waist can be tricky if you dont have a perfectly flat tummy and can accentuate the tiniest bump however this dress sits perfectly on the waist and is actually super slimming i wasnt 100 sold on the pattern or color i wish it was more off white than brown but the fit was so great that i had to buy it the dress,Recommend,Recommend

after reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale im tall and lean but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures firstly the top has a strange transition to the skirt with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together if you blouse it and lay flat it invariably gets bunched as you wear it this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks creating less clean lines i also found the blue black,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

the lace on this top is pretty and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos but did nothing for me on between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front it just sort of hung shapelessly on me i also found the back to be much shorter than 305it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected the shoulders fit me well and because the top was boxy already i didnt want to size up for length for reference i tried on xs im 54 120 lbs,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

i definitely agree with the other reviews however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up or down as well as color options the tricky thing is that it runs super small im usually between a 6 or 8 2829 and ended up getting a size 10 i dont like high waisted skirts or pants so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable maybe best to try on in store but worth it,Recommend,Recommend
i got this top in green and im overall happy with it i agree with the other reviewers that the material is thin and the quality not top notch and it certainly is overpriced for what it is especially with the shipping fee however the style is really cute love the lace up in the back and if flows nicely without billowing as is the case with so many retailer swing tops lately i didnt find it to be so see through that it would need a cami at least not the green color and a nude strapless br,Recommend,Recommend

the pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like ive sometimes found the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric sort of like a double knit but with its own simple striped pattern the collar looks like it might be itchy but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly,Recommend,Recommend

i saw this dress online and loved it i ordered the blue denim one in my usual sizes an 8 and 10 but i think the 10 was sized wrong anyhow both were too small so when i returned them they were in the store i ended up with a size 12 which fits great with a little bit of room it is light weight simple but fun and very comfortable to wear i have received many compliments on it on my first day wearing it i also ordered it in white thinking that i might prefer that color but when it arri,Recommend,Recommend
this will be my goto shirt for fall its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleevethe neckline is unique the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest fit is slim nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering i will likely purchase more colors once on sale i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected my only drawback is how thin the material is i can see it getting snags or holes easily but i will deal,Recommend,Recommend

this top is so much prettier on you can dress it up or down it does run a tad large im 57 and 145 lbs i am usually in between a small and medium but usually a medium i went for the small on this and i loved the fit of it still pretty flowy and the medium would have been just too big it is a tunic so it runs kind of long a tiny bit too long for me but i will still wear it a lot,Recommend,Recommend
you would expect anything woolen to be slightly scratchy this is incredibly soft i couldnt belive its veltevty soft texture when i pulled it out of the carton i had to check the content ag immediately to comfim the cut is not too fussy but slimming and the sleeves are nice and long it was a little dissapointing that the usual attention to the styling on the back of the piece was missing here its a straight plain back with no darts plackets peplums or ruching,Recommend,Recommend
the cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined although the color is beautiful the cheap fabric has no variation is too saturated and lacks any sheen of quality silk shocked at the price i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre 2010 being back the quality,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

i bought this in my usual medium and it fits great fitted at the shoulder loose below it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories,Recommend,Recommend
i was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isnt my first choice that was the least of the problems with this jacket i love sparkle and i love beautiful detail none of the elements by themselves was a problem the sum of the parts didnt work though the end result was an unflattering confusing mess the silhouette plus the frayed edges plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast plus the zipper were just too many things to go t,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

im sure theres someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasnt me admittedly im a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5 tall still for a taller person this shirt runs short for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit c,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

this sweater looks alot better in person the picture online doesnt do it justice this can be used both as a sweater or even like a lightweight jacket a very versatile piece added to the wardrobe definitely worth the markdown price only con is that it has some fluffy pieces in the yarn that comes loose on wearing and sticks to other fabric so wearing it with black pants might cause a problem,Recommend,Recommend

beautiful unique design its very flattering the way the fabric hangs i usually wear a 10 but because the lining is much smaller than the dress which many linings are its a pet peeve of mine i sized up to a 12 and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly that said im very sensitive to that kind of thing other reviewers have noted that the emb,Recommend,Recommend

these are probably my 10th pair of pilcro legging jeans and though i love the color sort of a worn in soft black dark gray these particular pair fit a tiny bit more snug than any of my others it could be the fact that these are ankle length vs most others are long with the cords being extra long and cozy so i wonder if the fact that these are shorter they tend to sit on my legs a little differently it may also be just this pair was cut a tiny bit smaller i am toying with the idea of ask,Recommend,Recommend

i love the idea of this top i had reservations when i ordered it dt the large armholes but i envisioned wearing my cute cropped pilcro jean jacket with it it turned out to be a disappointment the armholes are gigantic and the sweater itself did not fit as on the model the front was much shorter and wider and basically stuck out from my body for reference i ordered the xxsp sizing up might have lengthened the front but would have exacerbated the armhole problem,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

i got this dress in the mail and while i loved the concept of it it really is too boxy the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist it is more so for show it is fully lined which was interesting and to me made the dress seem boxier the quality is good but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot but it would have still been a shapeless dress just bigger it does fit true to size,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

i absolutely love these pants they are so incredibly comfortable and fit is amazing they look awesome with sandals and boots and will transition perfectly into fall i definitely recommend sizing down like the other reviewers have suggested i originally purchased my normal size 27 but they were loose after wearing a little around the house i decided to exchange them for a 26 and they were a little snug at first but stretched out and fit perfect,Recommend,Recommend

when you order online you cant always be sure of the quality or sizing you will get like the other reviewers i found this piece to be beautiful and well made its made from rayon and not sheer the coral cream green and light gray flowers really pop against the black fabric this piece is meant to be swingy and loose however i started with a large but exchanged for a medium it still feels a little loose so if youre undecided about sizes order down,Recommend,Recommend

ordered in my normal size large and i love it beautiful fit striking pattern thats quite slimming the stripes are deep chocolate next to a mauve purple gray on a white background it looks black so lots of colors would work on top the fabrication is a soft rib knit and it has a substantial elastic waistband it overlaps in the front and the opening falls a bit high so that may be a deal breaker for some because it does expose some upper thigh i like the look but im 53 so it works well,Recommend,Recommend

this shirt is amazingly soft and has such a great cut especially for me being curvy i love to pair this with cute leggings or tight ankle jeans with my boots recently wore on a casual date with the hubby and he loved it paired with my dark brown leather jacket and dark jeans only reason i gave it 4 stars was that the shirt tends to stretch out a little at the bottom is seems as you wear it throughout the day it is still a great shirt and if possible i would buy more need to bring,Recommend,Recommend
this sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier the fabric is pretty lightweight but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season,Recommend,Recommend

this dress is beautiful the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up i also like loose fitting clothing and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler,Recommend,Recommend
i am very pleased with this purchase a nude colored racer back bra works perfectly under it and does not show through i have worn this with jean shorts and linen pants and it looks great with both it is slightly on the dressy side so i also plan to wear it to work paired with a skirt or dress pants and a cardigan i am a 34a and size small fits nicely,Recommend,Recommend
online this top looks fabulous but in person not so great great color nice quality for a lightweight top but when i tried it on the neck does not lay nicely too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck and i love cowl neck i found for me it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest so didnt work for reference im 54 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large i purchased a smal,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i was excited to receive this top because i love the design but was very disappointed when it arrived i thought the embroidery would be striking but its not the material is a tshirt knit which also added to the disappointment it was not flattering at all,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i just received these jeans and the fit it good but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already i hope it will go away otherwise i wasted 100,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i love the look of this dress the fitting could use some workthe top layer could be slightly more fittedbut overall it looks adorable as other reviewers have mentioned the top does not have any button loops my biggest issue with the dress is the quality of the material one time through the wash on the gentle cycle and the slip underneath has shrunk at least a full size for the price of this dress i dont expect disposable clothing if i had known it would shrink i wouldve hand wa,Recommend,Recommend
a good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes i mix them with my basics scarves and jewelry so i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses even though i felt it was pretty pricey when it arrived i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric it does nothing for any of my intended clothes so it is going back asap,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i love this shirt i had my eye on it for awhile but wasnt sure what size id be so i went to the store to try they only had a small which i figured i would be but it was a little large and not as fitted as i would like it across the chest i got an xs and it was perfect i am 51 about 120 lbs and a small c cup and it fits great i love it,Recommend,Recommend
love the color weight and styling on this sweater it is soft and comfortable and i will wear it a lot the only downfall is that it sheds so it can not be worn with leggings or you will end up with fuzz everywhere,Recommend,Recommend
as soon as i saw this piece online i knew i had to have it like other reviewers the black flower part on the shoulders can be itchy underneath it does run large but thats my style i love pairing pieces like this with skinny jeans or leggings and booties can be dressed up or down highly recommend,Recommend,Recommend
awesome pants they look a lot better in person than in these pictures i got it in dark blue they are very comfortable and can be used day to night if you like cropped pants and wide legs this one is a good option its a bit more dressy than other models still look casual and fun i may end up getting a couple more for myself,Recommend,Recommend
this is a tts cami that should be a staple in everyones closet great for layering,Recommend,Recommend
ive had a hard time finding the right jumpsuit and havent ha a lot of luck with retailer clothing lately but this is perhaps my favorite retailer purchase of all time im petite and busty 52 34cd and was pleasantly supposed at how well this fits the pattern is a bit faded like the best kind of vintage find so it works for someone short like me and because the back has a tie closure it can adjust as needed ill be wearing it with a sports bra that crosses in back with 4 straps whic,Recommend,Recommend
after reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xss was still wayyy too big for reference i am 53 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon such a disappointment the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details soft and not baggy a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier im 57 140 pounds with an athletic hourglass shape 32dd i bought the 2 which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt im normally an retailer small but i dont think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted great comfy weekend piece,Recommend,Recommend
i love everything about this dress the coloring fabric and flow of it its so much better in person than online its true to size and very comfortable a great price as well,Recommend,Recommend
i was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering whatwasithinking when you try it on later when i bought this once i tried this on at home i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing theres so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back i wanted to love t,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i adore this dress it has a fairly thick material which helps the skirt stay full and is very flattering if like me your thighs or tummy can be a problem area in dresses the only downside for me is the fact that i have fairly narrow shoulders so the seam for the sleeves tends to stick out a bit i get lots of compliments on this one,Recommend,Recommend
first of all the label on this dress is maeve not nue by shani second i just wasnt impressed the fabric is coolit has a sort of embossed look to it and its somewhat shiny which sets it apart in a good way but the cut is just boring the top felt dowdy to meoverall i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i was urged to try this on by my usual stylist as she thought it would look nice with shorts i purchased or jeans or pencil skirt i own she knows a lot of what i own it is truly pretty love the embroidered cut outs makes the tank look stylish the cut is also flattering though i think ill have to wear a strapless bra color is also warm enough to work on pale skin like me or a golden tan i purchased the 0 regulr tried on petite but i found it was short and flared too much i am 115 lbs 30,Recommend,Recommend
these are a wonderful trouser style pant i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isnt my top pick but its a cute style thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut,Recommend,Recommend
this is the perfect little throwon dress flattering ubercomfortable nice fabric i found that it runs slightly large,Recommend,Recommend
the neutral color was at my local retailer which is a rich brownmocha much nicer looking in person like others this is quite sheer and thin however it is so stretchy breathable and comfortable that i would use this for layering instead for my 59 36c hourglass frame i found the medium to be rather body hugging it was not at all loose like on the model for me this is fine because i will layer eliminating issues of sheerness,Recommend,Recommend
i purchased this on sale xxs petite and im glad i did its an adorable sweater but i knew the moment i put it on itch city bummer i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped its a very warm sweater and the style is really cute looks really soft and cozy but i would say itchy and cozy,Recommend,Recommend
the detail on this dress is lovely its unusual and wellmade from soft fabric it is big though i would usually wear a medium and ordered a petite small to give you a sense of how large it is i am currently 33 weeks pregnant and bought this to wear after the pregnancy i can actually get it on now over the considerable baby bump it doesnt look good but i can in fact get it on hoping it wont be way too large postpregnancy but it seems to fit fine in the shoulders now definitely,Recommend,Recommend

cute and super comfortableso its the best of both worlds it fits true to size but i bought a size up to add a little extra length love the soft blue color and ruffles,Recommend,Recommend
really nice green blend of colors fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket is a bit itchy need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath,Recommend,Recommend

i so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful colorbutthe fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips first the fit the arm pits are low and dont actually tuck into where your armpits are so you have this weird restriction in arm movement then the design is not great either and others mentioned this the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
this top has really beautiful lace detail the color is much deeper pink than the picture online i ordered the xs petite and it fits fine but i like my tops longer so i wish i had gotten the regular xs instead it is very pretty,Recommend,Recommend
the color says red but its more like a rust im 53 so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything finally returned it without it making it out the door,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
cant wait for the weather to get warmer so i can wear this one as others have said the material is heavier but i think thats a positive as it is very structured and slimming im a fan of maeve dresses and this is no different,Recommend,Recommend
i am very surprised by the low reviews of this dress this dress is obviously a very loose fitting style it is a bit of a man repellar dressthe quality of the fabric is beautiful and the pattern stunning i find the loose flowy style liberating and comfortable i love it with otk boots and tights for winter but also planning to wear with sandals in spring i am 125lbs and purchased the petite small,Recommend,Recommend
this is a very nice jumpsuit reviewers were correct stating that torso is long fit better a taller person as soon as i read the reviews i went on and placed an order for size 8 im 6ft tall 160lb and it has been very difficult to find a jumpsuit to fit my long torso this one however turned out to be perfect true to size and fit not only that the fabric is very soft and good quality very interesting style of the jumpsuit looks much better in person i particularly liked cropped widel,Recommend,Recommend

love this dress ive already worn it many times i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured the length is great and works with tights or boots great unique dress,Recommend,Recommend
i bought the pink one i like this salmon pink color not too girly type of pink the material is super soft and light i have skinny torso so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash it shrunk one size when i bought it size s it covered my flat hips fits just like the picture but now my hips are showing i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold air dry,Recommend,Recommend
this is a really nice dress for the money i definitely had to size down ive always taken a 4 in hd in paris tops so i initially ordered a 4 but it was a little too big in the chest area i wear a 32dd so normally this isnt my issue i replaced it with a 2 and it fits great i also have a long torso which can be an issue for me with dresses but this one works on me this is definitely a good dress for taller girls the material is high quality too im going to wear it to my friends we,Recommend,Recommend
chic and comfortable and looks great with skinny jeans or leggings im usually a smallmedium and thought the medium had a better overall look sleeves were just a little long the detail on the sleeves is kind of like the inside of a sweatshirt and makes it look a little more polished than the average athleisure top,Recommend,Recommend
this tee is super comfortable it feels and looks like a well worn favorite right off the rack although it only comes in sml sizes and i wear an xs 32ab 105 lbs the small fits well no gaping armhoes to worry about the pics dont show that the tee does trapeze out somewhat but it is not to worry about i purchased the reddish color which is a wonderful faded maroon shade i will be getting the black one as well,Recommend,Recommend
ordered these to wear around the house more as leggings and they did the trick love the color and the fact that they are warm without being too thick,Recommend,Recommend
as another reviewer mentioned maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent i ordered a 4 and while it fits i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders and im a thin build the length on this was also a little weird to mea little swingyflared but also short making me feel like id always be playing with it while wearing the orange print is absolutely adorable i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don,Recommend,Recommend

this is a really great top it is really soft and made very well it could be a casual top with jeans or dress up with some chunky jewelry and cute heels i wasnt sure which size to get because i mostly get mediums amd i sometimes get a large i ended up going with a large and it seemed to be just a little too big but it doesnt have that look at all it looks so much better in person than on the computer overall a very cute top,Recommend,Recommend
cute and very soft but the elastic wasnt sewn in right i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess disappointing for more expensive loungewear,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
i read the existing reviews before purchasing and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer i figured by ordering a medium i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater this was not the case the sweater is short does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind and i assume the model is taller than ias models are usually tall for reference i am 56 medium build,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
glad i went in to buy this in store i was surprised by the texture which was much more cotton almost gauzelike than most cloth stone shirts made with tencel the blue looks like demin online but in person is a rather ugly dark blue the pink was almost red but the yellow was beautiful it is doublelined which is one of the best things about it im usually between a s and m and could have gone either way but choose m because it was a little longer and flowyer,Recommend,Recommend
love this dress im 57 135 lbs and typically wear either a small or xsmall in maeve since this one has lots of extra fabric i ordered it in an xs and xxs they were basically the same everywhere except the xxs had a much shorter weave pattern at the top so i ended up keeping the xs its great dress lots of room and swings nicely,Recommend,Recommend
i have received so many compliments its my favorite,Recommend,Recommend
i have had this shirt for a little over a month ive wore it maybe 35 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder its not even on a seam so i cant fix it i expect much better quality from retailer dont buy this the quality is very disappointing which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts,Not Recommend,Not Recommend

i am 52 120lbs and bought the 4 petite which is what i normally wear and it fits perfectly the quality of the fabric and stitching is good not great and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment but for me the style the fit and the fact that it doesnt seem to show wrinkles at least not before washing turned it in to a keeper for me the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it i tried the ada belt with it but found i,Recommend,Recommend
for me a good pencil skirt makes me feel so ladylike i love eva franco pencils but be warned they are designed to be a tight fit through the tush i wear a 12 and i ordered the 12 in this skirt the pouch another reviewer pointed out seems intended to be a pocket but because the skirt fits me pretty snugly it doesnt stick out when i walk and sit the fabric does seem like it would snag easily so ill choose accessories thoughtfully for reference i have a 33 waist and 42 hips,Recommend,Recommend

i bought this cardigan in both rose and nude and i absolutely love both the weight is perfect for spring and fall and i love the details in the back and the pockets i thought the rose would be hard to match for tops but i have a number of things that work with it it fits true to size in my opinion,Recommend,Recommend
im super into this top i bought the evergreen color in store as it fit true to size and was very flattering i went to buy an item that was available online only and decided to also buy this top in black my favorite aspect about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down the material is slightly stretchy though it does not cling i can wear a chunky necklace and dressy skinny pants and look ready for a nice dinner on the other hand this top can be thrown on with a pair of comfy jeans,Recommend,Recommend
i really loved the uniqueness of this dress and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work but it was just a little too fitted for the office,Recommend,Recommend
i had mixed feelings about this dress the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd it has two slips one that fits close and a second thats a bit too puffy so the skirt didnt sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger the odd length made it unflattering it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i didnt want to risk it,Not Recommend,Not Recommend
