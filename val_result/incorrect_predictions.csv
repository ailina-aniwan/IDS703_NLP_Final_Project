these look nothing like the picture they are super highwaisted longer than they look in this picture i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90s that just fit terribly i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs they are far from it the color was also much lighter than shown in picture super unflattering just not for me theyre going back,Recommend,Not Recommend
i really liked this top when i saw it online i went to the store to check the sizes i am a small or a medium i tried on the s and the xs even the xs was huge unfortunately the xxs is sold out i dont understand the sizing on this at all its a shame because the top itself is very pretty just be sure you try it on before purchasing,Not Recommend,Recommend
these run small i normally wear 28 on ag stevies and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them,Not Recommend,Recommend
i really wanted this skirt to work but it didnt look very flattering on me a great midi length and very cool pattern so hopefully will work for others,Not Recommend,Recommend
i was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20 off event i would splurge i got the m as im tall 510 and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body the sleeve is cut too high for me i wish it was longer or even a longsleeved item the peachapricot nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces the sweatshirt pieces arent particularly soft eit,Not Recommend,Recommend
the jacket runs large so size down its a good jacket to throw on the go but i dont see this lasting long bc after he first wash it started piling the quality of the material isnt great,Recommend,Not Recommend
loved the fabric of this dress and the slip that comes with it i wish the waist line fit a little better though i am 54 with an athletic build and it looked really boxy on me i was so disappointed thought i could synch it in to make it work but think this is a return,Recommend,Not Recommend
i loved this dress in the photos and couldnt wait to try it on in person the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it i didnt mind too much but it didnt look like the dress the model is wearing i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my 52 frame which was a plus i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap not something i would expect from,Recommend,Not Recommend
i was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isnt a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill ive ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015 and have been very happy with them on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p it was much too,Not Recommend,Recommend
i ordered 2 sizes to try for in store pickup both were too large so size down i am 54 125 lbs and the s was too large in the neck and body even though i generally wear things large also the collar was a hemmed flat collar not the roll collar depicted i reviewed that with the salesperson as well we were both at a loss to explain why and the tiger embellishments were more orange yellow and glittery on the ones i ordered,Recommend,Not Recommend
i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 383040 i did not purchase this top,Not Recommend,Recommend
i got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great however after i washed it the first time it became clingy and stuck to me and doesnt lie right its such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe,Not Recommend,Recommend
the fabric is so thin i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normalsized letter envelope the problem is not going to be that the garment is seethrough which it is its the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky its cottoney and i suspect it will get stuck against the back of my shirtpants while im wearing it and not drape nicely i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly however im such a sucker for a pre,Recommend,Not Recommend
i purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but its thin and see through if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it,Not Recommend,Recommend
i ordered this shirt online and didnt even try it on it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i dont want to have that extra layer in the summer it is cute though,Recommend,Not Recommend
i am still in love with my ribboned denim dress from earlier this year so when i saw this dress i was super excited and ordered it right away in the same size it just came and im kinda disappointed the fit is shrunken kind of like im wearing a petite size its around 3 to 4 inches shorter the tie at the waist hits instead right under my bust and theres some weird bunching happening above my rear i kept wanting to pull the whole dress down more but thats just the way it was,Recommend,Not Recommend
i love the color and style of this sweater and was very eager to wear it which ive now done on two occasions but now im concerned about the quality and also wondering if there is a long version of this sweater and a shorter version i am 56 and thin but the sweater doesnt hit me mid thigh only goes to upper thigh and i measured 25 in length on my sweater rather than 30 which seems to indicate a shorter length than on the model i wish it were longer more a problem is that the fuzzy pa,Not Recommend,Recommend
the shirt was cute im very petite and it ran very wide so didnt fit me well,Recommend,Not Recommend
but not for me i usually try to buy petite sizes since i am only 5ft 0in but this was just too pretty to pass up so i took a chance and ordered a regular size xs right out of the bag i was impressed with the colors and fabric of this romper however i did not notice that the entire back was open until i put it on from the pictures it looks like there is a small opening but when i put it on i was exposed all the way down to my lower back this may not be the same for a taller person s,Recommend,Not Recommend
i loved this sweater when i bought it wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag it shrunk at least two sizes and the tassels got all tangled which i guess i should have seen coming pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on,Recommend,Not Recommend
i had been eyeballing this for a very long time because i loved the look of the skirt and this top of which i snagged the skirt when it went on sale i was delighted to finally take a chance and buy this when it went on sale too thoughts below pros it is well made and on the thicker side for a peplum it is actually slimming i am an hourglass and with hips which usually means such tops flare out so much making me look wider in all the wrong places so i was skeptical abo,Recommend,Not Recommend
im 55 and i think fairly proportioned 120 lbs 34b and the peplum hit well above my waist since having kids im a little obsessive about avoiding any shirt that could double as maternity and this struck me as one its a cute too but once its on i dont feel its very flattering,Not Recommend,Recommend
color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine now for the cons it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacockunder my arm which could be seen i guess if i waved the rest were parts of the bird i would love to have the one in the photos next who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea if i had gotten a nice patterned top i would have replaced the buttons blouses that i like never seem to b,Not Recommend,Recommend
this is an adorable top but it just wasnt my style im 40 and felt silly wearing a big bow but if you can rock this look id recommend it the top is a thin sweatshirt material not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric it is a cotton rayon blend the sweatshirt part is cropped but the striped shirt details come to a good length the shirt trim is 100 cotton the fit was true to size it is a bit loose not overly fitted but true to size it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar,Not Recommend,Recommend
i purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price i ordered the 2 petite but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person they are still very long to my ankles and the legs are very wide the waist fits fine though,Not Recommend,Recommend
i really loved this dress it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because im curvier on top would be great for slender figures,Not Recommend,Recommend
these pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public they are good quality and fit nicely but i feel like if youre over 20 theyre not really flattering or especially appropriate,Recommend,Not Recommend
this shirt arrived today and i was surprised how short it is not a tunic at all i wonder if the lengths on these vary and if i order it again it would be a different length i ordered my normal size xs petite im 52 so this should have been a tunic on me perhaps if i see this shirt in the store ill try on the regular length im returning the petite,Not Recommend,Recommend
first let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress but the fit is extremely loose they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress the photo of the back of the model where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate if it was i would love this dress the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline i am 57,Not Recommend,Recommend
this jacket is really pretty and unique unfortunately the material around the waist area does not lay flat like it does in the picture im 5 ft 6 in and a size 6 i ordered the medium it fit well but the material around the waist area jutted out making me look really wide disappointed to have to return this,Recommend,Not Recommend
i love this shirt i actually bought two in black my uniform then decided to order one in white as well however the white shirt fit differently than the two black ones it was significantly shorter over 2 shorter while the black tee is the perfect length the shorter white version wasnt flattering on me and kind of flared out around my waistnot the best look that being said i know the black shirt will be in heavy rotation for a while and the people at retailer were very und,Recommend,Not Recommend
its such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternityish so i returned it,Not Recommend,Recommend
after reading the reviews i was hoping to be able to try this on in store i was able to try on a xxs and a xs in the store on the sale rack i tried both on and i usually will take an xs or small in sweaters funny but the xxs seemed to be a little longer in the front and the fit is nicer on me after reading others review of this sweater i thought for sure it would be super short on the xxs but it wasnt just goes to show you should always try on first i did not feel that the sleeves were l,Recommend,Not Recommend
i purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit i love the top and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style alas the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough even though these are very comfortable leggings i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue,Recommend,Not Recommend
i waited and got this sweater at the winter sale i ordered the navy in a medium the design is pretty but as has been said i was surprised at how short it is i do love the detail the tie back nice weight i have not found it to be itchy the sweater i received was a store return and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy but for 35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over i do need to wear a cami underneath as the sides are more revealing than pictures the first day,Not Recommend,Recommend
i like the style and the design of this culottes but the texture of the fabric will caught on any rough surface i had a few loose loops for just one wear so it will be nice to wear for work or shopping but not good to go to the park or play with kids,Not Recommend,Recommend
i love tshirts by t la but unfortunately this particular one was different the sizing was off it ran small although i ordered my usual size medium for this brand i think the shirt is cute though,Recommend,Not Recommend
the button detail on the sides is a unique design detail i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides but i decided against purchasing this top it appeared shapeless on me i have a curvierathletic figure and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure,Recommend,Not Recommend
im being eyeballing this dress for quite a while finally i decided to jump on it and i was so ansy to receive it in the mail finally arrived and some how wasnt what i was expecting the front part has 2 pieces of fabric attached to the sides of the dress that wrap around your waist making that effect you see on the model to be honest i didnt like that at all i think they ruined the dress with that the dress is very comfortable feeling the fabric is super soft i can imagine wearing this,Recommend,Not Recommend
the kimono is as pictured the colors are true to what is shown on line though the description indicates green multiit is not green i returned the item however the quality is fine but it seemed extremely overpriced to me it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality,Not Recommend,Recommend
i fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me it is kind of a thick linencottony material and just didnt lay down well bunching out on the sides in a way i didnt find to be very flattering so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm but 3 stars for actual fit on alas it is going,Recommend,Not Recommend
i decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured only about 3 inches shorter i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late everything i seem to order is huge this was an exception and i could have ordered the s color was as pictured a nice green fabric was a gauzy cotton the dress was just alright nothing special to warrant the price tag it felt like a little girls dress on me,Not Recommend,Recommend
i saw this at the store today very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through from what i could see on my body it would have been too short in the crotch i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely i gave up cute shade of green though,Not Recommend,Recommend
i loved the actual design on the fabric the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them but the fabric was much too thin for me i was surprised because another review said they were thick to me it felt like tights material almost however they were not see through which is great overall they just didnt look great on my body 59 size 68 curves medium was a bit too loose,Not Recommend,Recommend
i gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much right boy was i wrong this is a sweater knit with a very deep vneck thats incredibly boxy and unattractive the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on i ordered in xl having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium it was swimming on me the stripes arent as cute in real life,Recommend,Not Recommend
this romper is cute i wont deny that however the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly however the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders im short but have a little wider shoulders so perhaps that was the issue it seems like another reviewer had the same problem there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down so i had to do some cont,Not Recommend,Recommend

this dress ran large on me i am a 10 sometimes an 8 but went with the 10 it just hung on me giving me no shape the colors are pretty and the dress was nice but i expected it to wow me more for the price sending back may try again if the next size makes it to sale,Recommend,Not Recommend
i liked the way the dress looked in the front but the material in the back was knit and very clingy i did not think it was flattering on me,Recommend,Not Recommend
i wanted to love this shirt i like the style the material is soft but it was so short on me perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else i wasnt even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short,Recommend,Not Recommend
pros soft quality top true to size and would look great a little tucked in and off the shoulder reality it will be hard to keep the shoulders from sliding up and on me at least it looked really mehkind of dumpy im 56 normally a medium8 and i bought the medium herefit was good its billowy and accurately displayed in the pictures so as an hourglass shaped gal id need to tuck in the front or all or accessorize to give it a little shape i really liked the feel a,Not Recommend,Recommend

this dress did end up working out for me however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a medlrg chest andor broad shoulders the fabric is light weight nice for summer it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be drapey i kept it,Not Recommend,Recommend
i really looked forward to receiving this piece it was however extremely difficult to get on and off you have to step into it and it is very narrow it is difficult to get your arms in and i had to have my husbands help getting it off i am 59 135 pounds i have a fit figure i ordered a medium i wear a small or xsmall for a top and an 8 in shorts or pants once it was on i was not thrilled with the extra material around the hips and tummy area it is not terribly becoming it bunches up,Recommend,Not Recommend

the craftmanship material not itchy at all to me are exquisite for this unique sweatercoat but the shape is not for me i have a slender build 58 130 lbs 34 b chest i oredered my usual sm which fit and the silouette of this piece looked ridiculous on me when buttoned the top half was nicely fitted not snug however the lower half ballooned out to overemphasize the hips due to the pleating in back the thing is i have no hips and having hips is a very good thing though not i,Recommend,Not Recommend
i did the happy dance when the dress arrived but the very sad dance when i tried it on unfortunately instead of following my instincts i took the review here and reviews from some other sites to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual huge mistake as in this dress was huge much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design for reference im 57 130lbs 34c i usually wear an 8 dress due to a very large rib cage i ordered the 10 but was literally swimming i think a 6 woul,Recommend,Not Recommend

reference 100 51 32a ordered size xs the suit is pretty under the neckline where the two orange panels meet the white center panel that corner puckers a bit this will not happen if you have a larger chest than my 32a or have a longerbroader torso so that the fabric can stretch out thus pulling that merging area flat the sides cut out lays flat when you stand up straight and gapes when your turnbend to the side i think this is expected the bottom section on the back c,Recommend,Not Recommend
this dress looks so beautiful on the model and i couldnt resist ordering it online i have an athletic build read small hips straight im 55 and 135 lbs i was very disappointed when i put on its made for a curvy build the dress was just too big especially around the hips i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build,Recommend,Not Recommend
loved the material and the style unfortunately my fears came true when i received this swimsuit and there wasnt enough support despite a review i had read as a 36d i thought the halter would be enough support however the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely i am sad i wont be keeping this though the material is heavenly,Not Recommend,Recommend
so this dress is extremely comfortable but its just really awkward i am on the fence about keeping it my husband loves it and thinks i should it just draws attention to the belly so any issues after having kids is very noticeable not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms very comfortable but not sure if i will keep it,Not Recommend,Recommend
love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected it is soft to the skin and flattering however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders,Not Recommend,Recommend
just tried layered sadie top and it felt so nice on good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed this item is definitely vanitysized im 51 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternityesque highly recommend because its gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you,Recommend,Not Recommend
this is a great dress nice soft fabric and the red is a nice vibrant tomato red color i ordered a small i am 54 and usually wear a 4 in dressed this dress was so huge it might be mismarked but labeled a small i will have to return it not even my seamstress can make it fit,Recommend,Not Recommend
okay i love the blouse this brand has in the same material so i thought id delight in this dress i am a 57 hourglass but have a longer torso i ordered the large in this usually a 10 or 12 fits me but the waist hit much higher than my natural waist and yet it was somewhat tight and completely rigid the bust area was a little loose and im a 36c then the bottom flared out in sort of a flower fairy poof above my knees which reminded me of a navy blue oompa loompa dress and i love my,Not Recommend,Recommend

another shirt i really wanted to love i adore green but so few tops are made in this color please make more however this shirt didnt work for me i think its a matter of where your curves live the shirt was true to size but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on probably a great shirt for different body types would love to see more green clothing,Recommend,Not Recommend
this is a very lovely looking sweater unfortunately it runs incredibly small im only 53 and the size small hit me above my midrise jeans it doesnt fit at all how its shown on the model its also a very delicate fabric seems like it would snag easily i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it but im sending it back,Not Recommend,Recommend

i ordered this in green when it was on sale and was so excited to get it i thought the color would compliment my complexion perfectly i read the other reviews who mentioned this item fit closer to the body than what is shown on the model i wish i would have listened while it is a very comfortable piece and stretches it is a lot tighter than i wanted and because of that it is a bit see through i didnt want to have to wear a cami underneath and i am pretty curvy this top does show many of,Not Recommend,Recommend
i really wanted to love this dress but it was so short im only 56 so i dont consider myself really tall but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt way too short for me my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt,Recommend,Not Recommend
i loved this dress as soon as i tried it on but it bunched up weird in the front around my hips i ordered a second size 4 hoping that it would fit better but same thing if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else fyi im 58 129lbs and im a runner its not like i have a huge backside or anything my guess is sizing is off ive tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly,Not Recommend,Recommend

gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso i sized up to get more length but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose well everything up top wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top i had to leave without this item but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise,Recommend,Not Recommend

i wore this immediately after receiving it as a gift after wearing it for almost 2 hours the fabric started to pill between my legs where it rubs sucks i actually really love this jumper and its very soft and comfortable just wish it would last longer im going to be wearing this all the time this summer but im pretty sure it will rub to the point where there will be holes in my pants between my legs only complaint about sizing is that the top is too big im 52 135lbs 34a,Recommend,Not Recommend

for the model to look like this pros nice quality the colors of the blue version at least are rich and beautiful note that the dark color pictured is really brown not black the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fallwinter it is layered over a bright navy poly slip cons i am 58 135 i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med the sleeves were more dolman than fitted i imagin,Not Recommend,Recommend

ordered these in 31p last year prob could have worn a 30p ordered 30p and 31p this year the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy this year neither size fit this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit its the waist that doesnt work for me if youre curvier this is probably a good fit change,Recommend,Not Recommend
i wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness such as myself i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting for me,Recommend,Not Recommend
the cut and print of this dress is beautiful however the armhole is way too low which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days please dont drop the armholes so low most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm,Recommend,Not Recommend

the sweater is nice but is very thin it is seethrough which does not make it a good fallwinter item for me the design structure of the sweater is nice looks slimming on which is a bonus i originally ordered my regular size s but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture this wasnt a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big overall i did not keep the seater as i thought,Not Recommend,Recommend
i wanted this jumpsuit to work so badly my regular size 2 crushed my girls flattening them and pushing them up over the top of the jumpsuit unfortunately i had to go up 2 dress sizes to get it to fit around my bust but was then so big that the material in the front was gapping and folding over for reference i am not overly busty a 34 c with petite but muscular build,Recommend,Not Recommend
i tried this dress on in the store prepared to buy this lovely piece i feel that it should have been a few inches longer it would look more proportionate next the tie is really difficult to place but it creates some great detail to the front and back it wrinkles easily i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear lastly it is not lined what a bummer at least the skirt could be lined but it does have pockets that is sweet,Not Recommend,Recommend
i ordered this online and when i opened the package i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top it is much nicer than a basic tshirt when i tried this on the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage also the overall length is listed as 27 long but i think that is the back of the shirt the front of the shirt is very short on me im 510 hitting well above my hip bones if only this was much m,Not Recommend,Recommend
the top is a pretty design its a low vneck but it would be nice for layering it was just way to tight runs small order up a size,Not Recommend,Recommend
i tried on xs in the store returned and it looked huge on me i like the rushing idea the material is super soft but overall couldnt justify even at sale with 40 off as it wasnt flattering when it looks big blue color nice in person,Recommend,Not Recommend
love the design its screams retailer and is form fitting flattering and super cute however the material has the itch factor for me its not lined and therefore quite scratchy along the collar as well what a shame,Recommend,Not Recommend
this top is cut too short wide with too much light material in between to be truly slimming flattering it needs to have more of the rayonspandex blend to make it heavier bouncier then it would hang appropriately and swing and hopefully not add pounds to the wearer unfortunately this top is too lightweight has too much material pass,Not Recommend,Recommend
it is indeed cut to the shape of a trench however i think retailer should rename it as its more like wearing a cardigan its soft and pretty which i like however i wasnt convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material,Not Recommend,Recommend

such a cute plaid print i couldnt resist ordering this but all of the petite sizes were sold out i went with the xs based on other reviews and it was just too huge i ended up returning it i think the xs petite may have worked but its sold out so ill never know it is boxy so you may need to be careful if that fit works for your body or not the colors are magnificent,Not Recommend,Recommend
this top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model it was not flattering for my larger bust with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist the quality is nice the fit in the shoulders is snug the length is a bit short for me but it may lay better on a different body type,Not Recommend,Recommend
i couldnt wait to get this dress from the online order the fabric looked so interesting to me linen appliqu pockets raw neckline the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion its like a little a line tent the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head im going to return it and try for a medium for reference i am 54 135 and usually wear a six or a small,Not Recommend,Recommend

i am almost always an xs in bottoms sz 02 but literally couldnt get the stretchy waistband no zip or fastening in xs up my hips in addition the brocade is a very lightweight polyestery tinselly weavedoes not suggest quality as others have noted it also runs short im 53 and this was a little below knee length on me not anklelength ive had luck with retailers sale section in the past including some items that didnt always start off with the best reviews but have no regret,Not Recommend,Recommend
lovely style i got the navy color and its beautiful im glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering but but but the sweater came pilled all over i dont know if it had been worn and returned or if its just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater because the style is so nice and it fits well im going to keep it and depill it but was disappointed with retailer,Recommend,Not Recommend
the fabric has a beautiful drape the skirt is a nice length and it blows moves and swings in a most flattering way the gray is a an elegant color and one could definitely wear the dress at both casual and more formal events the top however sags and overwhelms the more fitted lining too bad,Recommend,Not Recommend

the dress is great for pear shapes however i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing ordered a small 58 140 and i still think it may be a bit big the material is very comfortable not too thick or thin however i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric see the attached photo,Not Recommend,Recommend
the fabric of this top is lovely the fit not so it does not fit as shown on the model the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a swing top i am 59 slim build i ordered my usual size medium shoulders and back fit perfectly too much material around the middle had it had a straight cut to it as shown id keep it because it doesnt its going back,Not Recommend,Recommend
i ordered the black white 00 petite im 5 2 96 lbs and i order petite sizes all the time the length for the size i ordered is about 23 on the back from neckline which is great for me however the length on the sides is way too short the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 925 so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans not at all the way it shows on the model i would order 00 regular length but then the sleeves will b,Not Recommend,Recommend

i really wanted to love this dress the pattern is so much prettier in person i typically wear a medium sometimes a large in tops the medium in this dress was too tight in my chest the large fit my chest but was ridiculously large in other areas the front of the dress goes up pretty high for someone with a large chest and flows down there is a tie in the back but it doesnt do much to help with the shape in the front,Recommend,Not Recommend

i wore this for a few hours and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades the fabric is so fine that during the normal goingsabout of my day it gave way and no i didnt buy too small and the fabric didnt pull while i was driving or reaching for anything,Not Recommend,Recommend
i purchased this dress for my graduation the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online im kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress the fabric is 100 syntheticthe fit is great the dress is true to size,Not Recommend,Recommend

normally hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses this dress is a big thumbs down as most of these reviewers and myself point out the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you dont just get a peak of your bra you get to see the whole side of it secondly the bust of the dress would work only for an acup bra too small for the average woman the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself excelle,Not Recommend,Recommend

dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought id try it on the dress has lovely blue stripes hard to discern in the online photo which makes it a great yearround piece however like others have commented it is too low to wear to work will consider alternations to close the vneck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price,Not Recommend,Recommend
i am tall and typically wear a size 1012 so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a coverup than a tunic it fits like a poncho with my arms at my sides it fit me similar to the model picture but if i lift my arms to use them then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me the reason for that is that it doesnt really have sleeves its more like hol,Recommend,Not Recommend
the quality and color is great on this top the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true offthe shoulder look and to wear it as a cowl neck or actually looks like a boat neck just makes it too ordinary since i love the off the shoulder look it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering so i think my size was right the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other,Not Recommend,Recommend

i bought this in both the navy a more saturated blue in person gorgeous and green but both are going back it fit everywhere but in the upper arms even across my chest and i usually encounter the opposite i think it might just be the way its cut across the shoulders that dont allow for much movement so while beautiful and so incredibly soft it has to go back if you have slender arms i think it would be a great fit,Recommend,Not Recommend
i loved the look of this dress the moment i saw it but was ridiculously long at 53 i can usually get away with buying regular length longer dresses and pants with the help of heels if needed but not a chance this time this dress does not come in petite and the fringed bottom design of the dress would not allow for any type of altering either,Recommend,Not Recommend
